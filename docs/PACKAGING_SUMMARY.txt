## Testing the Build

After running build script:

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `build.bat` to create executable
2. ✅ Test with `test_leads.csv` and --skip-ai option
3. ✅ Verify output in `data/final/`
4. ✅ Create distribution package with USAGE.txt
5. ✅ Share with non-technical users

## Support Files Included

- **USAGE.txt**: 300+ lines, covers everything
- **QUICK_START.txt**: 1-page cheat sheet
- **launcher.py**: Interactive menu system
