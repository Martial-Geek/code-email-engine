                      COMPLETE WORKFLOW GUIDE
================================================================================

This document shows the complete journey from code to shipping to users.

================================================================================
PART 1: DEVELOPER SETUP (You - First Time Only)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Install PyInstaller
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   
   pip install pyinstaller


STEP 2: Build the Executable
   Double-click:  build.bat
   
   This creates: dist/ColdEmailEngine.exe
   
   ⏱️ Takes about 2-5 minutes


STEP 3: Test the Executable
   Open Command Prompt in the project folder:
   
   cd dist
   ColdEmailEngine.exe ..\data\raw\test_leads.csv --skip-ai
   
   You should see the normal pipeline output
   ✅ If successful, proceed to next step


STEP 4: Create Distribution Package
   Double-click:  package_distribution.bat
   
   This creates: ColdEmailEngine_Portable/ folder
   
   Inside will be:
   ✓ ColdEmailEngine.exe
   ✓ data/ folders
   ✓ USAGE.txt
   ✓ QUICK_START.txt
   ✓ launcher.py
   ✓ README.txt


STEP 5: Ship to Users
   Option A: Zip the folder and email
   Option B: Copy to USB drive
   Option C: Upload to cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc)

================================================================================
PART 2: USER EXPERIENCE (Non-Technical Users)
================================================================================

STEP 1: User Receives Package
   Extracts: ColdEmailEngine_Portable.zip
   
   Folder contains:
   📦 ColdEmailEngine_Portable/
      ├── ColdEmailEngine.exe
      ├── launcher.py
      ├── QUICK_START.txt
      ├── USAGE.txt
      └── data/
          ├── raw/          ← User puts CSV here
          ├── cleaned/
          ├── enriched/
          ├── scored/
          ├── emails/
          └── final/        ← Results appear here


STEP 2: User Puts CSV in data/raw/
   Exports leads from LinkedIn, Apollo, Hunter, etc.
   Saves as: leads.csv
   Places in: ColdEmailEngine_Portable/data/raw/


STEP 3: User Runs the Engine
   Option A - EASIEST (No command line needed):
      Double-click launcher.py
      Follow the menu:
         1. Select CSV file
         2. Choose: Full pipeline or Fast (skip AI)
         3. Wait for completion
   
   Option B - COMMAND LINE (Tech-savvy):
      Open Command Prompt
      Navigate to folder
      Type: ColdEmailEngine.exe leads.csv
      Or:  ColdEmailEngine.exe leads.csv --skip-ai


STEP 4: Wait for Results
   Pipeline Duration:
      • With AI:      15-30 minutes
      • Without AI:   2-5 minutes
   
   Progress shown in console window


STEP 5: Use the Results
   Results saved in: data/final/
   
   📄 instantly_upload.csv
      - Upload directly to Instantly.com
      - Ready to use in campaigns
   
   📧 email_templates.txt
      - View and customize email templates
      - Copy/paste into Instantly
   
   Other outputs in data/ folder for reference

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP FOR COMMAND LINE USERS
================================================================================

Full Pipeline (with AI):
   ColdEmailEngine.exe my_leads.csv
   
   Wait 20 minutes...
   Results in: data/final/instantly_upload.csv


Fast Version (no AI):
   ColdEmailEngine.exe my_leads.csv --skip-ai
   
   Wait 3 minutes...
   Same results, just faster!


Advanced - Run Individual Steps:
   Step 1: Clean
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step clean my_leads.csv
   
   Step 2: Scrape (after clean complete)
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step scrape my_leads_cleaned.csv
   
   Step 3: Score
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step score my_leads_enriched.csv
   
   Step 4: Email Guess
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step emails my_leads_scored.csv
   
   Step 5: Personalize
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step personalize my_leads_emails_best.csv
   
   Step 6: Sequence
      ColdEmailEngine.exe --step sequence my_leads_personalized.csv

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING FOR USERS
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "ColdEmailEngine.exe is not recognized"
SOLUTION: 
   1. Make sure exe is in the right folder
   2. Open Command Prompt in that folder
   3. Then run: ColdEmailEngine.exe leads.csv


PROBLEM: "File not found" error
SOLUTION:
   1. Check CSV is in data/raw/ folder
   2. Verify filename spelling
   3. Example correct: data/raw/leads.csv
   4. Wrong: leads.csv (from home folder)


PROBLEM: "No emails generated" or mostly blank emails
SOLUTION:
   This is normal if:
   • Companies don't follow standard email patterns
   • Website data couldn't be scraped
   • Some companies use custom domains
   
   The tool tries 8 different patterns. Some always fail.


PROBLEM: "Very slow" or "hanging"
SOLUTION:
   The scraper intentionally goes slow to avoid blocking.
   This is expected and normal.
   
   To speed up: Use --skip-ai option


PROBLEM: "API key error"
SOLUTION:
   Only needed if you want AI personalization.
   Use --skip-ai to skip this feature.


PROBLEM: Application closes immediately
SOLUTION:
   1. Open Command Prompt manually
   2. Navigate to the folder
   3. Type: ColdEmailEngine.exe leads.csv
   4. See actual error messages
